AMCF stands for 'AppManager Config File' and these are very important! These files represent 2 options!
A yes or no question. Instead of a config file, since this software uses batch. This method is used, to configure an option add a specific
file with a specific name, or don't!

The 'inst.amcf' file you see, tells the script wether an installation has been completed already. So the software doesn't crash upon an attempt to install when already installed.
